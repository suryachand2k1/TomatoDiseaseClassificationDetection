# Running the Tomato Image Detection and Classification Project

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the Tomato Image Detection and Classification project. Make sure to follow each step carefully to ensure the project runs smoothly.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine.
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed for running `.ipynb` files.
- Necessary libraries and dependencies installed (as listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the code folder).

### Step 1: Download the Code

Firstly, download the entire code folder for the Tomato Image Detection and Classification project. This folder contains all the scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and resources required to run the project.

### Step 2: Train the Model

1. **Open `plant_disease.ipynb`**: Navigate to the downloaded code folder and open the `plant_disease.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
   
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute all the cells in the Jupyter Notebook. This process will train the model on the dataset provided, tuning it for disease detection and classification in tomato plants.

3. **Model Output**: Upon completion, the trained model will be saved in the specified directory within the code folder.

### Step 3: Launch the Project

After training the model:

1. **Refer to the Screenshots Document**: Open the screenshots document provided with the project. This document contains step-by-step instructions and screenshots to guide you through running the project.

2. **Follow the Instructions**: Carefully follow the instructions in the screenshots document to launch and interact with the project interface.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
- Recheck the steps to confirm you haven't missed anything.
